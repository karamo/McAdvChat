1) With a fresh SD Card, bootstrap all system components
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DK5EN/McAdvChat/main/install_caddy.sh | bash

2) With the basesetup install all McAdvChat App Components
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DK5EN/McAdvChat/main/mc-install.sh | sudo bash

3) On a fresh system the server component needs to be configured
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DK5EN/McAdvChat/main/install_mcproxy.sh | bash

Script will stop, now edit the config file and put in the IP Address or DNS name of your MeshCom Node
sudo vi /etc/mcadvchat/config.json

Either UDP_TARGET can be reached via mDNS, then it's your Call-Sign and SID with Domian .local
Or you just enter the IP-Address, e.g.
"UDP_TARGET": "192.168.1.74",

save and exit, and restart the script that installs the service
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DK5EN/McAdvChat/main/install_mcproxy.sh | bash

4) later you can 
  journalctl -u mcproxy.service -f
  sudo systemctl stop  mcproxy.service
  sudo systemctl start  mcproxy.service
